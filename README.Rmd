This repo is a fork of [Folkh√§lsomyndigheten's repo](https://github.com/FohmAnalys/SEIR-model-Stockholm) 
containing the code for the SEIR model of the number of Covid-19 cases in 
Stockholm. I created this repo to understand their model better, find bugs or
improvements to their code. I list my findings below.

# Summary of changes

## Bugs

* In the original code, parameters are drawn from a distribution to calculate
uncertainty estimates. The implicit reason why one can do that is that the
optimization procedure is a maximum likelihood estimation, and such estimators
have an asymptotic normal distribution. However, this distribution is 
<i>multivariate</i> normal, but the original code draws each parmeter 
independently from each other. The code in this repo fixes this.

## Improvements

* Parameters are transformed to each lie on the real line before being passed
to `optim`. This fixes the non-convergence that the original code sometimes
displayed.
* Code has been parallelized via the `furrr` package where applicable, resulting
in a pretty good speedup.
* Uncertainty estimates are calculated for more quantities, such as the 
infectivity.

## Cosmetic changes

* Code now uses `tidyverse` packages to a much greater extent.
* Functions are documented (work in progress).
* Cleaner variable and function names.
* Nicer plots via `ggplot2`.

# Sensitivity analysis

Will explore model sensitivity to parameters `gamma`, `eta` and `p_symp` here.
